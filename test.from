What categories? They're usually merit based. If you're still in high school then focus on your SAT/ACT's. If you do well on the math sections of those and have decent grades you can usually find scholarships.
I think you got that phrase wrong :)
Yes.  Even Zerg units.  Infested Infestors.  It's like a Hydraroach.  Just grows another Infestor on top of it.

Not a complete bum but.. Amir Sadollah
Sort of. It's confirmation that the GOP would do well to accept gay marriage and legalize marijuana, but it's also confirmation that the GOP should stay pro-life and pro-second amendment.
We'll label it Agree to Disagree and call it a day. When DC hires us both as creative directors, then we shall revisit the matter... :)

Depends on the syntax.  I don't have time to exegete it right now though.
Good reference, terrible execution.
You can probably make the upgrade later. It doesn't cost that much to change the nozzle or the power supply. You just gotta calibrate it manually after putting on the new parts otherwise it might be similar to duct-taping a bazooka to a handgun.
How can you compare an average of 8 years to 4 years accurately?

I also operate a forklift everyday. I was thinking the same exact thing. 
More room and visible from the front door. I want him to walk on seeing me, not have to come find me. It's only a double, it's really not a big deal. 
thank you so much, info provided has helped immensely in focusing on these areas.  Yes I'll pack everything I own in the car but will likely park it forever and bike commute.  Can't wait!
